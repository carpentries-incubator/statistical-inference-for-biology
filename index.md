More data are better than less data, right? When interpreted through sophisticated analytical skills the answer could be yes. Absent these skills, analysts can be tricked by patterns in "big data" that appear by chance. This lesson presents statistical
skills and knowledge to help data analysts in the life sciences to avoid some of the most common pitfalls of big data. Lesson material is derived from the [HarvardX Biomedical Data Science](http://genomicsclass.github.io/book/) series, part of which is published as the book [Data Analysis for the Life Sciences](https://leanpub.com/dataanalysisforthelifesciences) (Irizarry & Love, 2016).
