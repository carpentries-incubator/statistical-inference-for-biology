## t-tests in Practice

#### Introduction

We will now demonstrate how to obtain a p-value in practice. We begin by loading
experimental data and walking you through the steps used to form a t-statistic 
and compute a p-value. We can perform this task with just a few lines of code 
(go to the end of this section to see them). However, to understand the 
concepts, we will construct a t-statistic from "scratch".


#### Read in and prepare data

We start by reading in the data. A first important step is to identify which rows are associated with treatment and control, and to compute the difference in mean. 


~~~
fWeights <- read.csv(file = "../data/femaleMiceWeights.csv") # we read this data in earlier
control <- filter(fWeights, Diet=="chow") %>%
  select(Bodyweight) %>% 
  unlist
treatment <- filter(fWeights, Diet=="hf") %>%
  select(Bodyweight) %>% 
  unlist
diff <- mean(treatment) - mean(control)
print(diff)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 3.020833
~~~
{: .output}

We are asked to report a p-value. What do we do? We learned that `diff`, 
referred to as the _observed effect size_, is a random variable. We also learned 
that under the null hypothesis, the mean of the distribution of `diff` is 0. 
What about the standard error? We also learned that the standard error of this 
random variable is the population standard deviation divided by the square root 
of the sample size:

![](../fig/02-stderr.png)

We use the sample standard deviation as an estimate of the population
standard deviation. In R, we simply use the `sd` function and the SE is:


~~~
sd(control)/sqrt(length(control))
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 0.8725323
~~~
{: .output}

This is the SE of the sample average, but we actually want the SE of `diff`. We 
saw how statistical theory tells us that the variance of the difference of two 
random variables is the sum of its variances, so we compute the variance and 
take the square root:


~~~
se <- sqrt( 
  var(treatment)/length(treatment) + 
  var(control)/length(control) 
  )
~~~
{: .language-r}

Statistical theory tells us that if we divide a random variable by its SE, we 
get a new random variable with an SE of 1.


~~~
tstat <- diff/se 
~~~
{: .language-r}

This ratio is what we call the t-statistic. It's the ratio of two random variables and thus a random variable. Once we know the distribution of this random variable, we can then easily compute a p-value.

As explained in the previous section, the CLT tells us that for large sample sizes, both sample averages `mean(treatment)` and `mean(control)` are normal. Statistical theory tells us that the difference of two normally distributed random variables is again normal, so CLT tells us that `tstat` is approximately normal with mean 0 (the null hypothesis) and SD 1 (we divided by its SE). 

So now to calculate a p-value all we need to do is ask: how often does a 
normally distributed random variable exceed `diff`? R has a built-in function, 
`pnorm`, to answer this specific question. `pnorm(a)` returns the probability 
that a random variable following the standard normal distribution falls below 
`a`. To obtain the probability that it is larger than `a`, we simply use 
`1-pnorm(a)`. We want to know the probability of seeing something as extreme as 
`diff`: either smaller (more negative) than `-abs(diff)` or larger than 
`abs(diff)`. We call these two regions "tails" and calculate their size:


~~~
righttail <- 1 - pnorm(abs(tstat)) 
lefttail <- pnorm(-abs(tstat))
pval <- lefttail + righttail
print(pval)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 0.0398622
~~~
{: .output}

In this case, the p-value is smaller than 0.05 and using the conventional cutoff 
of 0.05, we would call the difference _statistically significant_.

Now there is a problem. CLT works for large samples, but is 12 large enough? A 
rule of thumb for CLT is that 30 is a large enough sample size (but this is just 
a rule of thumb). The p-value we computed is only a valid approximation if the 
assumptions hold, which do not seem to be the case here. However, there is 
another option other than using CLT.

## The t-distribution in Practice

As described earlier, statistical theory offers another useful result. If the 
distribution of the population is normal, then we can work out the exact 
distribution of the t-statistic without the need for the CLT. This is a big "if" 
given that, with small samples, it is hard to check if the population is normal. 
But for something like weight, we suspect that the population distribution is
likely well approximated by normal and that we can use this approximation. 
Furthermore, we can look at a qq-plot for the samples. This shows that the 
approximation is at least close:

If we use this approximation, then statistical theory tells us that the 
distribution of the random variable `tstat` follows a t-distribution. This is a 
much more complicated distribution than the normal. The t-distribution has a 
location parameter like the normal and another parameter called 
*degrees of freedom*. R has a nice function that actually computes everything 
for us. 


~~~
t.test(treatment, control)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~

	Welch Two Sample t-test

data:  treatment and control
t = 2.0552, df = 20.236, p-value = 0.053
alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 -0.04296563  6.08463229
sample estimates:
mean of x mean of y 
 26.83417  23.81333 
~~~
{: .output}

To see just the p-value, we can use the `$` extractor:


~~~
result <- t.test(treatment,control)
result$p.value
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 0.05299888
~~~
{: .output}

The p-value is slightly bigger now. This is to be expected because our CLT 
approximation considered the denominator of `tstat` practically fixed 
(with large samples it practically is), while the t-distribution approximation 
takes into account that the denominator (the standard error of the difference) 
is a random variable. The smaller the sample size, the more the denominator 
varies. 

It may be confusing that one approximation gave us one p-value and another gave 
us another, because we expect there to be just one answer. However, this is not 
uncommon in data analysis. We used different assumptions, different 
approximations, and therefore we obtained different results.

Later, in the power calculation section, we will describe type I and type II 
errors. As a preview, we will point out that the test based on the CLT 
approximation is more likely to incorrectly reject the null hypothesis 
(a false positive), while the t-distribution is more likely to incorrectly 
accept the null hypothesis (false negative).

#### Running the t-test in practice

Now that we have gone over the concepts, we can show the relatively simple code 
that one would use to actually compute a t-test: 


~~~
control <- filter(fWeights, Diet=="chow") %>%
  select(Bodyweight) %>% 
  unlist
treatment <- filter(fWeights, Diet=="hf") %>%
  select(Bodyweight) %>% 
  unlist
t.test(treatment, control)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~

	Welch Two Sample t-test

data:  treatment and control
t = 2.0552, df = 20.236, p-value = 0.053
alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 -0.04296563  6.08463229
sample estimates:
mean of x mean of y 
 26.83417  23.81333 
~~~
{: .output}

The arguments to `t.test` can be of type *data.frame* and thus we do not need to 
unlist them into numeric objects.
