Technological changes in biomedical research drive data production in greater 
quantity and complexity. High-throughput technologies, such as sequencing 
technologies, produce data whose size and complexity require sophisticated 
statistical skills to avoid being fooled by patterns arising by chance. In the 
past researchers would measure, for example, the transcription levels of a 
single gene of interest. Now it is possible to measure all genes at once, often
20,000 or more depending on the organism. Technological advances like these have
driven a change from hypothesis to discovery-driven research. This means that 
statistics and data analysis in the life sciences are more important than ever.  

This lesson will introduce the statistical concepts and data analysis skills 
needed for success in data-driven life science research. We start with one of 
the most important topics in statistics and in the life sciences: statistical 
inference. Inference is the use of probability to learn population 
characteristics from data. A typical example is determining if two groups (for 
example, cases versus controls) are different on average. Specific topics 
include: 

  * p-values
  * the t-test
  * confidence intervals
  * association tests
  * permutation tests
  * and statistical power 
  
We make use of approximations made possible by mathematical theory, such as the 
Central Limit Theorem, as well as techniques made possible by modern computing.
