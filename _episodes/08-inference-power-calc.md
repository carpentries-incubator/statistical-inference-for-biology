## Power Calculations 

#### Introduction

We have used the example of the effects of two different diets on the weight of mice. Since in this illustrative example we have access to the population, we know that in fact there is a substantial (about 10%) difference between the average weights of the two populations:


~~~
library(dplyr)
pheno <- read.csv("../data/mice_pheno.csv") #Previously downloaded 

controlPopulation <- filter(pheno, Sex == "F" & Diet == "chow") %>%  
  select(Bodyweight) %>% unlist

hfPopulation <- filter(pheno, Sex == "F" & Diet == "hf") %>%  
  select(Bodyweight) %>% unlist

mu_hf <- mean(hfPopulation)
mu_control <- mean(controlPopulation)
print(mu_hf - mu_control)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 2.375517
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
print((mu_hf - mu_control)/mu_control * 100) #percent increase
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 9.942157
~~~
{: .output}

We have also seen that, in some cases, when we take a sample and perform a 
t-test, we don't always get a p-value smaller than 0.05. For example, here is a 
case where we take a sample of 5 mice and don't achieve statistical significance 
at the 0.05 level:


~~~
set.seed(1)
N <- 5
hf <- sample(hfPopulation, N)
control <- sample(controlPopulation, N)
t.test(hf, control)$p.value
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 0.5806661
~~~
{: .output}

Did we make a mistake? By not rejecting the null hypothesis, are we saying the 
diet has no effect? The answer to this question is no. All we can say is that we 
did not reject the null hypothesis. But this does not necessarily imply that the 
null is true. The problem is that, in this particular instance, we don't have 
enough _power_, a term we are now going to define. If you are doing scientific 
research, it is very likely that you will have to do a power calculation at some
point. In many cases, it is an ethical obligation as it can help you avoid 
sacrificing mice unnecessarily or limiting the number of human subjects exposed 
to potential risk in a study. Here we explain what statistical power means. 

#### Types of Error
insert a graphic and reduce the text

Whenever we perform a statistical test, we are aware that we may make a mistake. 
This is why our p-values are not 0. Under the null, there is always a positive, 
perhaps very small, but still positive chance that we will reject the null when 
it is true. If the p-value is 0.05, it will happen 1 out of 20 times. This 
*error* is called _type I error_ by statisticians. 

A type I error is defined as rejecting the null when we should not. This is also 
referred to as a false positive. So why do we then use 0.05? Shouldn't we use 
0.000001 to be really sure? The reason we don't use infinitesimal cut-offs to 
avoid type I errors at all cost is that there is another error we can commit: to 
not reject the null when we should. This is called a _type II error_ or a false 
negative. The R code analysis above shows an example of a false negative: we did 
not reject the null hypothesis (at the 0.05 level) and, because we happen to 
know and peeked at the true population means, we know there is in fact a 
difference. Had we used a p-value cutoff of 0.25, we would not have made this 
mistake. However, in general, are we comfortable with a type I error rate of 1 
in 4? Usually we are not.  


#### The 0.05 and 0.01 Cut-offs Are Arbitrary

Most journals and regulatory agencies frequently insist that results be 
significant at the 0.01 or 0.05 levels. Of course there is nothing special about 
these numbers other than the fact that some of the first papers on p-values used 
these values as examples. Part of the goal of this book is to give readers a 
good understanding of what p-values and confidence intervals are so that these 
choices can be judged in an informed way. Unfortunately, in science, these 
cut-offs are applied somewhat mindlessly, but that topic is part of a 
complicated debate.

#### Power Calculation

Power is the probability of rejecting the null when the null is false. Of course 
"when the null is false" is a complicated statement because it can be false in 
many ways.

![](../fig/delta-eq.png)

could be anything and the power actually depends on this parameter. It also 
depends on the standard error of your estimates which in turn depends on the 
sample size and the population standard deviations. In practice, we don't know 
these so we usually report power for several plausible values of <i>&Delta;, 
&sigma;<sub>X</sub>, &sigma;<sub>Y</sub></i> and various sample sizes.
Statistical theory gives us formulas to calculate power. The `pwr` package 
performs these calculations for you. Here we will illustrate the concepts behind 
power by coding up simulations in R. 

Suppose our sample size is: 


~~~
N <- 12
~~~
{: .language-r}

and we will reject the null hypothesis at:


~~~
alpha <- 0.05
~~~
{: .language-r}

What is our power with this particular data? We will compute this probability by 
re-running the exercise many times and calculating the proportion of times the 
null hypothesis is rejected. Specifically, we will run: 


~~~
B <- 2000
~~~
{: .language-r}

simulations. The simulation is as follows: we take a sample of size *N* from 
both control and treatment groups, we perform a t-test comparing these two, and 
report if the p-value is less than `alpha` or not. We write a function that does 
this:


~~~
reject <- function(N, alpha=0.05){
   hf <- sample(hfPopulation, N) 
   control <- sample(controlPopulation, N)
   pval <- t.test(hf, control)$p.value
   pval < alpha
}
~~~
{: .language-r}

Here is an example of one simulation for a sample size of 12. The call to 
`reject` answers the question "Did we reject?" 


~~~
reject(12)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] TRUE
~~~
{: .output}

Now we can use the `replicate` function to do this `B` times. 


~~~
rejections <- replicate(B, reject(N))
~~~
{: .language-r}

Our power is just the proportion of times we correctly reject. So with  *N = 12* 
our power is only: 


~~~
mean(rejections)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 0.2155
~~~
{: .output}

This explains why the t-test was not rejecting when we knew the null was false. 
With a sample size of just 12, our power is about 23%. To guard against false 
positives at the 0.05 level, we had set the threshold at a high enough level 
that resulted in many type II errors. 

Let's see how power improves with N. We will use the function `sapply`, which 
applies a function to each of the elements of a vector. We want to repeat the 
above for the following sample size:


~~~
Ns <- seq(5, 50, 5)
~~~
{: .language-r}

So we use `apply` like this:

~~~
power <- sapply(Ns,function(N){
  rejections <- replicate(B, reject(N))
  mean(rejections)
  })
~~~
{: .language-r}

For each of the three simulations, the above code returns the proportion of 
times we reject. Not surprisingly power increases with N:


~~~
plot(Ns, power, type="b")
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-08-power_versus_sample_size-1.png" title="Power plotted against sample size." alt="Power plotted against sample size." width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Similarly, if we change the level `alpha` at which we reject, power changes. The 
smaller I want the chance of type I error to be, the less power I will have. 
Another way of saying this is that we trade off between the two types of error. 
We can see this by writing similar code, but keeping *N* fixed and considering 
several values of `alpha`:


~~~
N <- 30
alphas <- c(0.1, 0.05, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001)
power <- sapply(alphas, function(alpha){
  rejections <- replicate(B, reject(N, alpha=alpha))
  mean(rejections)
})
plot(alphas, power, xlab="alpha", type="b", log="x")
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-08-power_versus_alpha-1.png" title="Power plotted against cut-off." alt="Power plotted against cut-off." width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Note that the x-axis in this last plot is in the log scale.

There is no "right" power or "right" alpha level, but it is important that you 
understand what each means.

To see this clearly, you could create a plot with curves of power versus N. Show 
several curves in the same plot with color representing alpha level.

#### p-values Are Arbitrary under the Alternative Hypothesis

Another consequence of what we have learned about power is that p-values are 
somewhat arbitrary when the null hypothesis is not true and therefore the 
*alternative* hypothesis is true (the difference between the population means is 
not zero). When the alternative hypothesis is true,  we can make a p-value as 
small as we want simply by increasing the sample size (supposing that we have an 
infinite population to sample from). We can show this property of p-values by 
drawing larger and larger samples from our population and calculating p-values. 
This works because, in our case, we know that the alternative hypothesis is 
true, since we have access to the populations and can calculate the difference 
in their means.

First write a function that returns a p-value for a given sample size *N*:


~~~
calculatePvalue <- function(N) {
   hf <- sample(hfPopulation,N) 
   control <- sample(controlPopulation,N)
   t.test(hf,control)$p.value
}
~~~
{: .language-r}

We have a limit here of 200 for the high-fat diet population, but we can see the 
effect well before we get to 200. For each sample size, we will calculate a few 
p-values. We can do this by repeating each value of *N* a few times.


~~~
Ns <- seq(10,200,by=10)
Ns_rep <- rep(Ns, each=10)
~~~
{: .language-r}

Again we use `sapply` to run our simulations:


~~~
pvalues <- sapply(Ns_rep, calculatePvalue)
~~~
{: .language-r}

Now we can plot the 10 p-values we generated for each sample size:


~~~
plot(Ns_rep, pvalues, log="y", xlab="sample size",
     ylab="p-values")
abline(h=c(.01, .05), col="red", lwd=2)
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-08-pvals_decrease-1.png" title="p-values from random samples at varying sample size. The actual value of the p-values decreases as we increase sample size whenever the alternative hypothesis is true." alt="p-values from random samples at varying sample size. The actual value of the p-values decreases as we increase sample size whenever the alternative hypothesis is true." width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Note that the y-axis is log scale and that the p-values show a decreasing trend 
all the way to 10<sup>-8</sup> as the sample size gets larger. The standard 
cutoffs of 0.01 and 0.05 are indicated with horizontal red lines.

It is important to remember that p-values are not more interesting as they 
become very very small. Once we have convinced ourselves to reject the null 
hypothesis at a threshold we find reasonable, having an even smaller p-value 
just means that we sampled more mice than was necessary.  Having a larger sample 
size does help to increase the precision of our estimate of the difference 
<i>&Delta;</i>, but the fact that the p-value becomes very very small is just a 
natural consequence of the mathematics of the test.  The p-values get smaller 
and smaller with increasing sample size because the numerator of the t-statistic
has <i>&radic;N</i> (for equal sized groups, and a similar effect occurs
when <i>M &ne; N</i>). Therefore, if <i>&Delta;</i> is non-zero, the t-statistic
will increase with <i>N</i>.

Therefore, a better statistic to report is the effect size with a confidence 
interval or some statistic which gives the reader a sense of the change in a 
meaningful scale. We can report the effect size as a percent by dividing the 
difference and the confidence interval by the control population mean:


~~~
N <- 12
hf <- sample(hfPopulation, N)
control <- sample(controlPopulation, N)
diff <- mean(hf) - mean(control)
diff / mean(control) * 100
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 5.196293
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
t.test(hf, control)$conf.int / mean(control) * 100
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] -7.775307 18.167892
attr(,"conf.level")
[1] 0.95
~~~
{: .output}

In addition, we can report a statistic called
[Cohen's d](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size#Cohen.27s_d),
which is the difference between the groups divided by the pooled standard
deviation of the two groups. 


~~~
sd_pool <- sqrt(((N-1) * var(hf) + (N-1) * var(control))/(2 * N - 2))
diff / sd_pool
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 0.3397886
~~~
{: .output}

This tells us how many standard deviations of the data the mean of the high-fat 
diet group is from the control group. Under the alternative hypothesis, unlike 
the t-statistic which is guaranteed to increase, the effect size and Cohen's d 
will become more precise.
