## Central Limit Theorem in Practice

Let's use our data to see how well the central limit theorem approximates sample averages from our data. We will leverage our entire population dataset to compare the results we obtain by actually sampling from the distribution to what the CLT predicts.

head(pheno)

  Sex Diet Bodyweight
1   F   hf      31.94
2   F   hf      32.48
3   F   hf      22.82
4   F   hf      19.92
5   F   hf      32.22
6   F   hf      27.50

Start by selecting only female mice since males and females have
different weights. We will select three mice from each population.


~~~
library(dplyr)
controlPopulation <- filter(pheno, Sex == "F" & Diet == "chow") %>%  
  select(Bodyweight) %>% unlist
hfPopulation <- filter(pheno, Sex == "F" & Diet == "hf") %>%  
  select(Bodyweight) %>% unlist
~~~

We can compute the population parameters of interest using the mean function.


~~~
mu_hf <- mean(hfPopulation)
mu_control <- mean(controlPopulation)
print(mu_hf - mu_control)

We can compute the population standard deviations of, say, a vector <i>x</i> as well. However, we do not use the R function `sd` because this function actually does not compute the population standard deviation <i>&sigma;<sub>x</sub></i>. Instead, `sd` assumes the main argument is a random sample, say <i>X</i>, and provides an estimate of <i>&sigma;<sub>x</sub></i>, defined by <i>s<sub>X</sub></i> above. As shown in the equations above the actual final answer differs because one divides by the sample size and the other by the sample size minus one. We can see that with R code:


~~~
x <- controlPopulation
N <- length(x)
populationvar <- mean((x-mean(x))^2)
identical(var(x), populationvar)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] FALSE
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
identical(var(x)*(N-1)/N, populationvar)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] TRUE
~~~
{: .output}

So to be mathematically correct, we do not use `sd` or  `var`. Instead, we use the `popvar` and `popsd` function in `rafalib`:


~~~
library(rafalib)
sd_hf <- popsd(hfPopulation)
sd_control <- popsd(controlPopulation)
~~~
{: .language-r}

Remember that in practice we do not get to compute these population parameters.
These are values we never see. In general, we want to estimate them from samples. 


~~~
N <- 12
hf <- sample(hfPopulation, 12)
control <- sample(controlPopulation, 12)
~~~
{: .language-r}

As we described, the CLT tells us that for large <i>N</i>, each of these is approximately normal with average population mean and standard error population variance divided by <i>N</i>. We mentioned that a rule of thumb is that <i>N</i> should be 30 or more. However, that is just a rule of thumb since the preciseness of the approximation depends on the population distribution. Here we can actually check the approximation and we do that for various values of <i>N</i>.

Now we use `sapply` and `replicate` instead of `for` loops, which
makes for cleaner code (we do not have to pre-allocate a vector, R
takes care of this for us):


~~~
Ns <- c(3,12,25,50)
B <- 10000 #number of simulations
res <-  sapply(Ns,function(n) {
  replicate(B,mean(sample(hfPopulation,n))-mean(sample(controlPopulation,n)))
})
~~~
{: .language-r}

Now we can use qq-plots to see how well CLT approximations works for these. If in fact the normal distribution is a good approximation, the points should fall on a straight line when compared to normal quantiles. The more it deviates, the worse the approximation. In the title, we also show the average and SD of the observed distribution, which demonstrates how the SD decreases with <i>&radic;N</i> as predicted. 


~~~
mypar(2,2)
for (i in seq(along=Ns)) {
  titleavg <- signif(mean(res[,i]), 3)
  titlesd <- signif(popsd(res[,i]), 3)
  title <- paste0("N=", Ns[i]," Avg=", titleavg," SD=", titlesd)
  qqnorm(res[,i], main=title)
  qqline(res[,i], col=2)
}

Here we see a pretty good fit even for 3. Why is this? Because the
population itself is relatively close to normally distributed, the
averages are close to normal as well (the sum of normals is also a
normal). In practice, we actually calculate a ratio: we divide by the
estimated standard deviation. Here is where the sample size starts to
matter more. 


~~~
Ns <- c(3, 12, 25, 50)
B <- 10000 #number of simulations
##function to compute a t-stat
computetstat <- function(n) {
  y <- sample(hfPopulation, n)
  x <- sample(controlPopulation, n)
  (mean(y) - mean(x))/sqrt(var(y)/n + var(x)/n)
}
res <-  sapply(Ns, function(n) {
  replicate(B, computetstat(n))
})
mypar(2,2)
for (i in seq(along=Ns)) {
  qqnorm(res[,i], main=Ns[i])
  qqline(res[,i], col=2)
}
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-05-t_test_qqplot-1.png" title="Quantile versus quantile plot of simulated ratios versus theoretical normal distribution for four different sample sizes." alt="Quantile versus quantile plot of simulated ratios versus theoretical normal distribution for four different sample sizes." width="540" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

So we see that for <i>N = 3</i>, the CLT does not provide a usable
approximation. For <i>N = 12</i>, there is a slight deviation at the higher
values, although the approximation appears useful. For 25 and 50, the
approximation is spot on.

This simulation only proves that <i>N = 12</i> is large enough in this case,
not in general. As mentioned above, we will not be able to perform
this simulation in most situations. We only use the simulation to
illustrate the concepts behind the CLT and its limitations. In future
sections, we will describe the approaches we actually use in practice. 

These exercises use the female mouse weights data set we have previously 
downloaded.

> ## Exercise 1
> The CLT is a result from probability theory. Much of probability theory was 
> originally inspired by gambling. This theory is still used in practice by 
> casinos. For example, they can estimate how many people need to play
> slots for there to be a 99.9999% probability of earning enough money to cover

> Suppose we are interested in the proportion of times we see a 6 when rolling 
> n=100 die. This is a random variable which we can simulate with 
> `x=sample(1:6, n, replace=TRUE)` and the proportion we are interested in can 
> be expressed as an average: `mean(x==6)`. Because the die rolls are 
> independent, the CLT applies. We want to roll <i>n</i> dice 10,000 times and 
> keep these proportions. This random variable (proportion of 6s) has mean
> <i>p=1/6</i> and variance <i>p &times; (1-p)/n</i>. So according to 
> CLT <i>z</i> = `(mean(x==6) - p) / sqrt(p * (1-p)/n)` should be normal with 
> mean 0 and SD 1.  
> Set the seed to 1, then use `replicate` to perform the simulation, and report

> should be about 0.05).

> ## Exercise 2
> For the last simulation you can  make a `qqplot` to confirm the normal
> approximation. Now, the CLT is an asympototic result, meaning it is closer 
> and closer to being a perfect approximation as the sample size increases. 
> In practice, however, we need to decide if it is appropriate for actual sample
> sizes. Is 10 enough? 15? 30?
> In the example used in exercise 1, the original data is binary (either 6 or not).
> In this case, the success probability also affects the appropriateness of the 
> CLT. With very low probabilities, we need larger sample sizes for the CLT to 
> "kick in". Run the simulation from exercise 1, but for different values of
> <i>p</i> and <i>n</i>. 
> For which of the following is the normal approximation best?  
> A) <i>p</i>=0.5 and <i>n</i>=5  
> B) <i>p</i>=0.5 and <i>n</i>=30  
> C) <i>p</i>=0.01 and <i>n</i>=30  
> D) <i>p</i>=0.01 and <i>n</i>=100

> ## Exercise 3
> As we have already seen, the CLT also applies to averages of quantitative 
> data. A major difference with binary data, for which we know the variance 
> is <i>p(1 - p)</i>, is that with quantitative data we need to estimate the
> population standard deviation.
> In several previous exercises we have illustrated statistical concepts with 
> the unrealistic situation of having access to the entire population. 
> In practice, we do not have access to entire populations. Instead, we obtain 
> one random sample and need to reach conclusions analyzing that data. `pheno`
> is an example of a typical simple dataset representing just one sample.

> `unlist`  
> `Y <- filter(dat, Diet=="hf") %>%`   
> `select(Bodyweight) %>%`  
> `unlist`
