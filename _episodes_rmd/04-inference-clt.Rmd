## Central Limit Theorem and t-distribution
Below we will discuss the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) and the t-distribution, 
both of which help us make important calculations related to probabilities. Both 
are frequently used in science to test statistical hypotheses. To use these, we 
have to make different assumptions from those for the CLT and the 
t-distribution. However, if the assumptions are true, then we are able to 
calculate the exact probabilities of events through the use of mathematical 
formula.

#### Central Limit Theorem 

The CLT is one of the most frequently used mathematical results in science. It 
tells us that when the sample size is large, the average Y&#772; of a random 
sample follows a normal distribution centered at the population average 
&mu;<sub>Y</sub> and with standard deviation equal to the population standard 
deviation &sigma;<sub>Y</sub>, divided by the square root of the sample size 
*N*. We refer to the standard deviation of the distribution of a random variable 
as the random variable's *standard error*.

This implies that if we take many samples of size *N*, then the quantity: 

![](../fig/02-random-sample.png)

is approximated with a normal distribution centered at 0 and with standard 
deviation 1.

We are interested in the difference between two sample averages. Again, applying 
certain mathematical principles, it can be implied that the below ratio:  

![](../fig/02-diff-sample-avgs.png)

is approximated by a normal distribution centered at 0 and standard deviation 1. 
Calculating p-values for the standard normal distribution is simple because we 
know the proportion of the distribution under any value. For example, only 5% of 
the values in the standard normal distribution are larger than 2 (in absolute 
value):

```{r calc_pvalue}
pnorm(-2) + (1 - pnorm(2))
```

We don't need to buy more mice, 12 and 12 suffice.

However, we can't claim victory just yet because we don't know the population 
standard deviations: &sigma;<sub>X</sub> and &sigma;<sub>Y</sub>. These are 
unknown population parameters, but we can get around this by using the sample 
standard deviations, call them *s<sub>X</sub>* and *s<sub>Y</sub>*. These are 
defined as: 

![](../fig/02-sample-stddev.png)

Note that we are dividing by *M-1* and *N-1*, instead of by *M* and *N*. There 
is a theoretical reason for doing this which we do not explain here.

So we can redefine our ratio as

![](../fig/02-sqrtN.png)

if *M = N* or in general,

![](../fig/02-ybar-xbar.png)

The CLT tells us that when *M* and *N* are large, this random variable is normally distributed with mean 0 and SD 1. Thus we can compute p-values using the function `pnorm`.

#### The t-distribution

The CLT relies on large samples, what we refer to as *asymptotic results*. When the CLT does not apply, there is another option that does not rely on asymptotic results. When the original population from which a random variable, say *Y*, is sampled is normally distributed with mean 0, then we can calculate the distribution of: 

![](../fig/02-tdist.gif)

This is the ratio of two random variables so it is not
necessarily normal. The fact that the denominator can be small by
chance increases the probability of observing large
values. [William Sealy Gosset](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Sealy_Gosset),
an employee of the Guinness brewing company, deciphered the
distribution of this random variable and published a paper under the
pseudonym "Student". The distribution is therefore called Student's
t-distribution. Later we will learn more about how this result is
used.

Here we will use the mice phenotype data as an example. We start by
creating two vectors, one for the control population and one for the
high-fat diet population:

```{r control_hf}
# pheno <- read.csv("mice_pheno.csv") #We downloaded this file in a previous section
controlPopulation <- filter(pheno, Sex == "F" & Diet == "chow") %>%  
  select(Bodyweight) %>% unlist
hfPopulation <- filter(pheno, Sex == "F" & Diet == "hf") %>%  
  select(Bodyweight) %>% unlist
```

It is important to keep in mind that what we are assuming to be normal here is the distribution of <i>y<sub>1</sub>,y<sub>2</sub>,...,y<sub>n</sub></i>, not the random variable Y&#772;. Although we can't do this in practice, in this illustrative example, we get to see this distribution for both controls and high fat diet mice:

```{r population_histograms, fig.cap="Histograms of all weights for both populations.",fig.width=10.5,fig.height=5.25}
library(rafalib)
mypar(1,2)
hist(hfPopulation)
hist(controlPopulation)
```

We can use *qq-plots* to confirm that the distributions are relatively
close to being normally distributed. We will explore these plots in
more depth in a later section, but the important thing to know is that
it compares data (on the y-axis) against a theoretical distribution
(on the x-axis). If the points fall on the identity line, then the
data is close to the theoretical distribution.

```{r population_qqplots, fig.cap="Quantile-quantile plots of all weights for both populations.",fig.width=10.5,fig.height=5.25}
mypar(1,2)
qqnorm(hfPopulation)
qqline(hfPopulation)
qqnorm(controlPopulation)
qqline(controlPopulation)
```

The larger the sample, the more forgiving the result is to the
weakness of this approximation. In the next section, we will see that
for this particular dataset the t-distribution works well even for
sample sizes as small as 3. 

All the above exercises relate to the normal distribution as an approximation of the distribution of a fixed list of numbers or a population. We have not yet discussed probability in these exercises. If the distribution of a list of numbers is approximately normal, then if we pick a number at random from this distribution, it will follow a normal distribution. However, it is important to remember that stating that some quantity has a distribution does not necessarily imply this quantity is random. Also, keep in mind that this is not related to the central limit theorem. The central limit applies to averages of random variables. Let’s explore this concept.
